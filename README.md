This is a basic todo list app where we can manage all our daily tasks.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Testing Brief

We can add our task by writting it in the placeholder.
To Update it use the Pen icon, and to delete it the Trash icon. 
If we want to mark it as done, then click on the task completed. It'll be marked done by strikethrough text and will be visible.
